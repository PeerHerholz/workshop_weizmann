    "`Python` is on its way to become the most used programming language in `neuroscience`. It is easy to understand, can be learned rather quickly and has a very strong and helpful community behind it. There exist many amazing `neuroimaging` software packages, such as `Nipype`, `Nilearn`, `fMRIPrep` and more which facilitate the everyday life of a neuroscientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this 2-day workshop is to introduce participants to many different `neuroimaging toolboxes`, the Python framework around it and everything you need to know about [Nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to start creating your own `pipelines` and optimizing your `workflows`.\n",
