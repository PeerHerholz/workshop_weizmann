# Nipype

Welcome to the [Nipype]() portion of the workshop! It covers the basic concepts and most common
use cases of `Nipype` and will teach you everything so that you can start creating your own
workflows in no time. We recommend that you start with the introduction section to familiarize
yourself with the tools used in this tutorial and then move on to the basic concepts section to
learn everything you need to know for your everyday life with `Nipype`. The workflow examples
section shows you a real example of how you can use `Nipype` to analyze an actual dataset. For a
very quick non-imaging introduction, you can check the [Nipype Quickstart notebooks]() in the
introduction section.

All of the notebooks used in this tutorial can be found on <a href="https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial">github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial</a>. Please note that this is an adapted
version of the [Nipype tutorial overview page](https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/) that
was slightly changed to work within the `jupyter book`, as well as workshop setting. The tutorial is divided into 4 distinct parts as noted below: `Introduction`, `Basic concepts`, `Workflow examples` and `Advanced concepts`. To get more information and go through the respective sections, please navigate via the `ToC` on the left.
 
Please note, that Binder provides between 1G and 4G RAM memory and thus some notebooks from
[Workflow Examples]() might not work. All notebooks from [Introduction]() and [Basic Concepts]()
parts should work.
