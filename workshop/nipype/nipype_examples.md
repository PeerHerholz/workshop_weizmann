# Example workflows

Now that we have explored the basic `building blocks` of `nipype` and seen them in action based on rather short examples, it's time to explore how these things are implemented in the wild. For this we will go through some realistic `workflow` examples that are also more complex and combine most of the things we talked about so far in isolation. 

To provide you with an idea about such `workflows` through different stages of `data analyses` you can find `examples` for `preprocessing`, `individual level analyses`, `normalization` and `group level analyses` in the `ToC` on the left.  

Please note that there are two types of `notebooks` in this section: `example` and `hands-on` `notebooks`. While the `example notebooks` are rather short and code-based, the `hands-on notebooks` are longer and contain more in-depth explanations of what is going on. Thus, the first are more like "this is how you could these things" and the second are more like "this is how and why you do these things", aka more teaching-focused.

To also show you how widely `nipype` is used as the underlying `workflow engine` in `complex processing pipelines`, we gathered a few examples in the below slide deck. To situate things accordingly, this also entails information on the larger ecosystem `nipype` is a part of and how it interacts with other tools and resources therein.
