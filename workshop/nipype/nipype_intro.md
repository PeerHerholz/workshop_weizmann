# Introduction to Nipype

**What is Nipype?**

- open-source, community-developed software package written in Python  

- provides unified way of interfacing with heterogeneous neuroimaging software like 
  SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, AFNI, ANTS, Camino, MRtrix, MNE, Slicer and many more  

- allows users to create flexible, complex workflows consisting of multiple processing steps using any software package above  

- efficient and optimized computation through parallel execution plugins  

`Nipype` gives you the possibility to select the algorithms that you prefer from many different `software packages` and combine them in one pipeline.

In short, you can have all the advantages without the disadvantage of being stuck with a `programming language` or `software package`.

The following deck of slides provides more detailed information:

Through the `introduction notebooks` which you can find in the `ToC` on the left, we want to provide you with some great showcases
and examples that demonstrate `nipype`'s capabilities. Additionally, we will show you how to obtain the `data` necessary to run the 
subsequent `tutorials`. Thus, please make sure to go through the `dataset notebook` if you want to run the `tutorials` `interactively`
(independent of your setup: `docker`, `conda` or `binder`).
