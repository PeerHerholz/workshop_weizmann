# Advanced and specialized analyses

At this point we already explored quite a bit of content, going from basics in `data handling & wrangling` to workflow creation using `nipype`. However, you might think: well, this all looks cool, but how do I do "insert analysis type here"? Say no more because as hinted at many times before, the `python - neuroimaging - ecosystem` is tremendously versatile and basically has a library for all the things you might want to do. Unfortunately, we don't have the time to check out most of them...We therefore want for an approach that splits the content into two parts: the most common analyses will be showcased in `jupyter notebooks` and many others will be mentioned and briefly introduced via `slides`. Regarding the first, we will go through `querying datasets`, `statistical analyses`, `functional connectivity`, `machine learning` and `diffusion imaging`. Please find the respective sections in the `ToC` on the left. Concerning the second, we gathered a fair amount of additional `python packages` and provide some information in a `slide deck` which you can find below. Please note that there are many more things out there, so if you are interested in an analysis that is not covered here, please let the instructors know and we can most likely provide with a set of tools that might be helpful.
