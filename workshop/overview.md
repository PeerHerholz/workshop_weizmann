# Workshop overview

As mentioned on the [Welcome page](https://peerherholz.github.io/workshop_weizmann/index.html), this workshop will be focused on how to utilize `python` to conduct neuroimaging analyses. In general, the idea is to do a split between basics in `data handling` and `analysis building blocks` via `nipype` background with a few examples and hands-on work. Regarding the first, we will try to provide folks with a brief overview of central aspects and important issues and concerning the second, evaluate a versatile set of `analysis approaches`.  We will explain both aspects, as well as the `setup`, etc. below.

## The framework and setup

The entire workshop will be conducted via the [Jupyter ecosystem](), utilizing the [python programming language]() for all examples in both sessions. All materials will be provided within the [Jupyter Book]() format you're currently look, free for everyone to check and try out, as well as utilize further. To help folks that don't have any experience with these resources, we compiled a set of tutorials that participants can go through within the [prerequisite section](). While this won't be enough to go past basic skills, we still hope it will be useful to familiarize yourself with core aspects that will help during the workshop. Each of these tutorials, as well as "main" materials will be in [jupyter notebooks]() and contain a mixture of explanations and code and presented as a "slide show" during the workshop. They can be just viewed, or either run interactively via cloud instances (via [mybinder]()) or locally. Depending on a given participant's computational resources and infrastructure, we provide multiple ways to participate in the workshop as outlined in the [Setup for the workshop](https://peerherholz.github.io/workshop_weizmann/setup.html) section.
