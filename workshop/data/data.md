# Basics in data handling

[Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) are two `python packages` that help to `load`, `modify`, `save` and `visualize neuroimaging data`.
The two software packages together allow you to do almost anything with your `MRI data` that you want. In order to provide a quick
introduction and overview of their functionality and capabilities we prepared two short notebooks that will showcase that. You can find
both in the `ToC` on the left.


`Nibabel`'s main focus is on `loading` and `saving` any kind of `neuroimaging data`.

`Nilearn`'s main focus is on `statistical learning` (based on [scikit-learn]()) but is also very good in `manipulation` and `visualizing neuroimaging data`.
