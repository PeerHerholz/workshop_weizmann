# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the "MRI analysis in Python using Nipype, Nilearn and more" workshop conducted at the The Azrieli National Institute for Human Brain Imaging and Research, we're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow the workshop, as well as respective materials. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/workshop_weizmann) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain analyses via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is plugin](https://web.hypothes.is/) with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

# Python & neuroimaging
  

You can checkout the respective sections:

* [An overview]()

   What's this workshop about and how is it organized?

* [Setup]()

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline]()

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Prerequisites]()

   All things gotta start somewhere and neuroimaging analyses in `python` are of course no exceptions to that, especially since a certain amount of digital literacy, programming, etc. is required. 
   Here, we gathered some resources folks can check out in preparation for the course or just for fun.

* [Data handling & Nipype]()

   Within the first part of the workshop, we will focus on the basics and will talk about neuroimaging data handling in `python` and the `analysis pipeline` tool [Nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): what is it
   and what are important aspects folks should know about?

* [Advanced and specialized topics]()

   After going through the basics, we will focus on specific analysis types and how they can be conducted using `python`, including [statistical modelling](), [connectivity analysis]() and [machine learning]().


* [Code of Conduct]()

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

# I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties going through the workshop, please donâ€™t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is to
[open an issue](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/workshop_weizmann/issues) on the
[GitHub site of the Workshop](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/workshop_weizmann) (also possible via the GitHub button at the top of the pages).
We would also highly appreciate and value every feedback or idea or you
might have (via [issues](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/workshop_weizmann) or [hypothes.is annotation feature](https://web.hypothes.is/) on the right).
