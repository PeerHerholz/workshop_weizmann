# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the documentation page for the GORELLA base
skeleton, we're glad to see you here!
For more information on the GORELLA project see
[here](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/).

Within these pages, we provide the basic elements needed to implement the
GORELLA framework on your lecture.

## What's all this now?

GORELLA stands for "Generalizable Outline for Realistic Empirical Life
Science Lectures and their Applications". It is a framework aimed to
improve openness and sustainability in scientific teaching and training.
GORELLA is designed to help you prepare and supply lecture content
in a way that it is [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) for as
many people as possible.

You can use the following sections to organize the content of your lecture:

* [GORELLA - an overview](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/overview.html)

   What's the problem and how are we propose to solve it?

* [General procedure](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/procedure.html)

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Introduction & theory building](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/introduction_theory_building.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and scientific projects are no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Data analyses](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_basedata_analyses.html)

   How to obtain insights from data?

* [Results communication](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/results_communication.html)

   Where should the acquired knowledge to be disseminated?

* [Symposium](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/symposium.html)

   What to do about outreach and discourse creation?

* [Student projects](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/projects.html)

   Making sure the work and progress of the participants is transparent and
   documented.

* [Questionnaires](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_base/questionnaires.html)

   Was it worth it and how can this be evaluated?

* [GORELLA tutorial](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/tutorial.html)

   Are there guidelines on how to start?

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties applying the GORELLA framework
to your lecture, please donâ€™t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is to
[open an issue](https://github.com/G0RELLA/gorella_base/issues) on the
GitHub site of the GORELLA base skeleton.
We would also highly appreciate and value every feedback or idea or you
might have.
