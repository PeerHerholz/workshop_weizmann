# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Let's rip one band-aid off right away: the current scientific and academic system is incredibly flawed and tremendously biased. Unfortunately, most students are not brought into contact with the respective issues during their studies and thus quite often perceive the present inequalities as "normal" and a given. This lead to the proliferation of exceptionally unfair "standards" and practices towards minorities and underrepresented groups. What's needed to combat these things are Universities, Departments, Lecturers, etc. that address these issues, as well as inform and enable folks to actively engage in the process towards increasing [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(business)) ([#DEI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DEI?src=hashtag_click)) at all levels. 

You might think: "Why should I care and what does it have to do with me? I just want to learn something here.". Well, even though you might not be (knowingly) affected, someone you know most likely will be and it will take all of us to change this for the better. In order to become aware of the systemic problems and issues others are facing and take corresponding actions, one needs to be able to make informed decisions based on a broad foundation of knowledge and this needs to be enabled asap. 

Thus, please take the time and effort to delve into this crucial topic by checking the resources linked below and utilizing them as a starting point. Please note that these things will be frequently updated. If you stumble across something that should be included, please contact the instructor so that it can be added.     


## Overview materials & introduction to DEI

### other material

Here's an informative Wikipedia article on  ["First-generation college students in the United States"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_college_students_in_the_United_States). While it's obviously focused on the US education system, a lot of the outlined issues/problems/obstacles/hurdles are faced by first-gen students all over the world.

## Initiatives

Please note that this list will be rather "neuroscience-focused" as it's the instructor's main field of expertise/work. However, other resources will be added asap and frequently.

### Women in Neuroscience Repository

The [Women in Neuroscience Repository](https://www.winrepo.org/) aims to "identify and recommend female neuroscientists for conferences, symposia or collaborations." via providing a fantastic interactive resource organized by a multitude of keywords. There's also a [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Twitter_Logo_as_of_2021.svg/1920px-Twitter_Logo_as_of_2021.svg.png" width="20" height="15">](https://twitter.com/WINRePo1) account.
